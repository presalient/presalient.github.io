Static website with three.js and Bootstrap

GPU accelerated implementation of the late [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

## Heavily Adapted from:

I refactored/removed redundant code as well as documented the more complex parts

Was originally just a javascript conway single threaded :(

## TODO
- Make it not so intense looking
- Add some orange ones to fight the white
- Mouse interaction
- Use promises to load shader files (?)
- Store pixel's age and fade based on age to remove still life over time
