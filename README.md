# My Personal [Website](https://stevenhuyn.github.io)

GPU accelerated implementation of the late [Conway's game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using three.js and bootstrap for the rest of the website.

Previously my website was just a javascript single threaded version. I wanted to see if I could make it run on GPU.

Heavily Adapted from this [codepen](https://codepen.io/asdfmario/pen/MBpVJJ)

## Todo

- [x] Add some orange ones to fight the white
- [x] Mouse interaction
- [x] Touch interaction
- [x] Store pixel's age and fade based on age to remove still life over time
