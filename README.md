# My Personal [Website](https://stevenhuyn.github.io)

Static website with three.js and Bootstrap

GPU accelerated implementation of the late Conway's game of life

## Heavily Adapted from:
https://codepen.io/asdfmario/pen/MBpVJJ

I refactored/removed redundant code as well as documented the more complex parts

Was originally just a javascript conway single threaded :(

## TODO
- Make it not so intense looking
- Add some orange ones to fight the white
- Mouse interaction
- Use promises to load shader files (?)
